# Note that the SUSE build for romana requires that someone has
# already generated a suitable tarball from the source tree by invoking
# `make suse-tarball`.  This will result in a tarball named similar to
# romana-X.Y+git.TIMESTAMP.COMMIT.tar.gz.  Don't bother with
# `make rpm`, just use build.opensuse.org with this spec file and the
# appropriate tarball.
#
# NOTE: You will have to edit the Version tag in this spec file to match
# your tarball, once you've checked them in to the build service.
